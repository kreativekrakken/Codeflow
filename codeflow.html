        <p class="main1">I am a mechanical engineering graduate from <span class="imp">NIT Kurukshetra</span>. Whilst is college covid struck. So I knew right away that if I had to stay relevant, I had to gain some technical knowledge to survive in this digital world. Plus am more of a <span class="imp">economics</span> and <span class="imp">finance </span>geek than coding.</p>
        <p class="main1">Thus I started first with economics courses on platforms like udemy and had some truly valuable education in that sphere. In fact, my first college level internship as a financial analyst at <span class="imp">Goldman Sachs</span> was also partly due to this reason and my soft skills.</p>
        <p class="main1">But my childhood dream was to be an entrepreneur. So I thought of starting this blog to educate and also review upcoming tech. And <span class="imp">Fintech</span> was my most obvious choice. Thus was born ours beloved Kreative Krakken. Am glad I had support of all of you guys and hope this continues well into the future :)</p>
